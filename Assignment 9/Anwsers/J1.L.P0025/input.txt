"            The        falling leaves, drift by my windows               
.           .          . : the Autumn         leaves of      "          red and gold " .
I see your lips ,  the Summer  kisses,
the sunburned  hands  I  used  to hold.
  since   you            went away    , the days            grow long.
     And soon I                 hear Old Winter         song.
but I miss you most of all.  my darling,
    when the    Autumn  leaves    start to fall.. "
