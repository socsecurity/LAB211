"The falling leaves, drift by my windows.
. . .: The autumn leaves of" red and gold.
I see your lips, the summer kisses.
The sunburned hands i used to hold.
Since you went away, the days grow long.
And soon i hear old winter song.
But i miss you most of all. My darling.
When the autumn leaves start to fall. .
